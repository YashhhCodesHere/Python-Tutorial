A dog is a domesticated carnivorous mammal that typically has a long snout, 
an acute sense of smell, and a barking, howling, or whining voice. 
Dogs are known for their loyalty, companionship, and ability to be trained. 
They come in various breeds, sizes, and colors, each with its own unique characteristics. 
Dogs are often kept as pets and are valued for their affectionate nature and their ability to provide emotional 
support to their owners. They are also used for various purposes such as herding, hunting, and assisting people with disabilities.
